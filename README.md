## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to provide a detailed comparison between the `insert` and `erase` functions of `std::vector` and `std::list` in C++.

## Build and Run
To clone and run this project, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Hayk10002/ListVSVector

# Go into the repository
$ cd ListVSVector

# We need to generate the executable in Release configuration to be able to observe the time difference between std::list and std::vector

# Generate the build files
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B build

# Build the project
$ cmake --build build --config Release
```

Then, run the executable generated in the `build` directory.

## Possible Output

```

## Why `std::vector` is Faster
In this project, we observe that `std::vector` generally performs faster than `std::list` for the `insert` and `erase` operations. This is because `std::vector` stores elements in contiguous memory, which allows for better cache locality and faster access times. Although `std::vector` may require shifting elements during insertion and deletion, the overall performance benefits from the reduced overhead of pointer manipulation and better memory access patterns compared to `std::list`, which uses a doubly linked list structure.
This project compares the performance of the `insert` and `erase` functions for `std::vector` and `std::list` in C++.
